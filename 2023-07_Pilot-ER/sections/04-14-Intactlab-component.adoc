=== Intactlab

As part of this pilot, Intactlab is looking at the following:

- Contacting with several business stakeholders about wildfire needs and usages, including climate scenarios
-	Starting experiments to access Emergency Geomatics Services (EGS) open data, as well as high-res LIDAR data
-	Reviewing existing internal wildfire risk models
-	Starting to benchmark and improve flood risk models
-	Updating business-wide geospatial architectures bit by bit
-	Conducting various experiments and analysis using QGIS, some of which will become our client demo
