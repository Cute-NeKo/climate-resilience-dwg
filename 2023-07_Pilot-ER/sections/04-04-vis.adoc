Presagis offered the V5D rapid 3D (trial) Digital Twin generation capability to Laubwerk
Presagis gathered open source GIS dataset for the Hollywood region in order to match the location of the tree dataset from Laubwerk
Using V5D, Presagis created a representative 3D digital twin of the building and terrain.
Presagis imported Laubwerk tree point dataset providing vegetation type information inside V5D
Presagis provided V5D Unreal plugin to Laubwerk in order to allow the insertion of the Laubwerk 3D tree (as Unreal assets) into the scene.
Using V5D, Laubwerk is capable of adapting the tree model in order to demonstrate the impact of climate change on the city vegetation


Presagis also provided to Laubwerk its V5D AI extracted vegetation dataset in order to complement the existing tree dataset as needed.

Laubwerk will use V5D to assign a representative 3D model based the on point feature attribution accessible in V5D. With V5D, this operation takes seconds to do and visualize the result in 3D.]
 

=== viszualisation of vegetation // work from laubwerk 

Laubwerk is a private company working on building a large database of vegetation that includes fully detailed 3D models as well as metadata to represent its properties.

- Component: Visualization of an example tile of Los Angeles with full vegetation coverage and using our plant metadata to compute and visualize different climate scenarios and mitigation measures.

- Inputs:
  * Laubwerk plant database for 3D models and plant metadata
  * Los Angeles - Bureau of Street Services - Tree Inventory (https://streetsla.lacity.org/tree-inventory)

- Outputs:
  * Imagery of the different projected scenarios
