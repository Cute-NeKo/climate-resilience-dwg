== Raw data to datacubes 

=== Introduction

Raw data and data cubes are two different forms of organizing and structuring data in the context of data analysis and data warehousing.

. Raw Data refers to the unprocessed, unorganized, and unstructured data that is collected or generated directly from various sources. It can include a variety of forms such as text, numbers, (geo) images, audio, video, or any other form of data. Raw data often lacks formatting or context and requires further processing or manipulation before it can be effectively analyzed or used for decision-making purposes. Raw data is typically stored in databases or data storage systems.
. Data Cubes, also known as multidimensional cubes are a structured form of data representation that organizes and aggregates raw data into a multi-dimensional format. Data cubes are designed to facilitate efficient and fast analysis of data from different dimensions or perspectives. They are commonly used in data warehousing.

Data cubes organize data into a multi-dimensional structure typically comprising dimensions, hierarchies, and cells. Dimensions represent various attributes or factors that define the data, such as time, geography, or products. Hierarchies represent the levels of detail within each dimension. Cells typically store the aggregated data values at the intersection of dimensions.

Data cubes enable users to perform complex analytical operations like slicing, dicing, drilling down, or rolling up data across different dimensions. They provide a summarized and pre-aggregated view of data that can significantly speed up query processing and analysis compared to working directly with raw data, something that is very valuable for the climate resilience community. Therefore, Data cubes are often used to support decision-making processes. The example below highlights an climate resilience related example of how to create and make available data cubes for wildfire risk analysis.

=== Using Datacubes for wildfire risk analysis

Ecere is providing a deployment of its GNOSIS Map Server with a focus on a Sentinel-2 Level 2A data cube. _OGC API - Tiles_, _OGC API - Coverages_, _OGC API - Maps_, _OGC API - Discrete Global Grid Systems_, _Common Query Language (CQL2)_, and  _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows & Chaining_ are the supported standards and extensions for this task.

The plan is to use machine learning process output from the Wildland Fire Fuel Indicator Workflow to identify vegetation fuel types from sentinel-2 bands, then combine with weather data to assess wildfire hazards risk in Australia.
The workflow will use as input the sentinel-2 OGC API data cube from our GNOSIS Map Server.

- Component: Data Cube and Wildfire vegetation fuel map / risk analysis.

- Inputs: ESA Sentinel-2 L2A data (from AWS / Element 84), Temperature / Precipitation / Wind climate data, Reference data for training: vegetation fuel type classification, wildfire risk.

The sentinel-2 Level 2A collection is provided at `https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a`

- Outputs: OGC API (Coverage, Tiles, DGGS, Maps) for Sentinel-2 data (https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a) including full global coverage, all resolutions/scales, all bands that can be individually selected, CQL2 expressions for band arithmetics; climate data (to be added), vegetation fuel type (possibly by end of pilot, or for DP2023), wildfire risk workflow (possibly by end of pilot, or for DP2023).

- What other component(s) can interact with the component: Any OGC API client component requiring efficient access to Sentinel-2 data, clients requiring climate data once made available, clients presenting vegetation fuel type, wildfire risk (once ready, might extend into DP2023).

- What OGC standards or formats does the component use and produce: 
  * OGC API (Coverage - with subsetting, scaling, range subsetting, coverage tiles; Tiles, DGGS (GNOSISGlobalGrid and ISEA9R), Maps (incl. map tiles), Styles), CQL2, OGC API - Processes with Part 3 for workflows (Nested Local/Remote Processes, Local/Remote Collection Input, Collection Output, Input/Output Field Modifiers) 
  * Formats: GNOSIS Map Tiles (Gridded Coverage, Vector Features, Map imagery, and more); GeoTIFF; PNG (16-bit value single channel for coverage, RGBA for maps); JPEG. 


==== Overview of standards and extensions available for outputs

===== OGC API - DGGS

There are two main requirements classes for this standard.

- Data Retrieval (What is here? -- "give me the data for this zone"),
- Zones Query (Where is it? -- "which zones match this collection and/or my query")

Example of data retrieval queries:

    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a/dggs/GNOSISGlobalGrid/zones/3-4-11/data
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a/dggs/ISEA9Diamonds/zones/E7-FAE/data

Example of a zones query:

    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA9Diamonds/zones
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/SRTM_ViewFinderPanorama/dggs/ISEA9Diamonds/zones?f=json (as a list of compact JSON IDs)

Level, Row, Column (which encoded differently in the compact hexadecimal zone IDs) can be seen on the zone information page at:

    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a/dggs/GNOSISGlobalGrid/zones/3-4-11
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a/dggs/ISEA9Diamonds/zones/E7-FAE

There are several different discrete global grids. Two are implemented in our service:

- Our GNOSIS Global Grid, which is geographic rather than projected, and is axis-aligned with latitudes and longitudes, but not equal area (though it tends towards equal area -- maximum variation is ~48% up to a very detailed level)
- ISEA9R, which is a dual DGGS of ISEA3H even levels, using rhombuses/diamonds instead of hexagons, but much simpler to work with and can transport the hexagon area values as points on the rhombus vertices for those ISEA3H even levels. It is also axis-aligned to a CRS defined by rotating and skewing the ISEA projection.

The primary advantage of OGC API - DGGS is:

- for retrieving data from DGGS that are not axis-aligned or have geometry that cannot be represented as squares (e.g., hexagons), or
- for the zone query capability, most useful for specifying queries (e.g. using CQL2). The extent to which we implement Zones Query at this moment is still limited.

===== OGC API - Coverages with OGC API - Tiles

Because they are axis-aligned, both of these DGGS can be described as a TileMatrixSet, and therefore equivalent functionality to the OGC API - DGGS Data Retrieval requirements class can be achieved using OGC API - Tiles and the corresponding TileMatrixSets instead.

==== GNOSIS implementation of OGC API for climate data cube (2016-2025 CMIP5 data)

There is now a fairly complete set of variables from the CMIP5 global dataset (from the Copernicus Climate Data Store) for the 2016-2025 time period available from our GNOSIS data cube implementation at:
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5
    
The variables on a single pressure level are organized as a single collection (coverage / data cube) at: https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:singlePressure (consisting of 9 fields: specific humidity, precipitation, snowfall, sea level pressure, downwelling shortwave radiation, wind speed, mean surface air temperature, maximum daily air temperature, minimum daily air temperature), while the variables on multiple pressure levels are organized into three separate collections:
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:byPressureLevel:temperature
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:byPressureLevel:gpHeight
    https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:byPressureLevel:windSpeed (consisting of two separate fields for Eastward and Northward wind velocity)
    
The temporal resolution of this dataset is daily, while the source spatial resolution is 2.5 degrees longitude x 2 degrees of latitude, and it is for 8 different pressure levels. Currently, the API supports requesting data from this data using OGC API - Tiles (coverage tiles as well as map tiles), Coverages, Maps and DGGS. With all these APIs, a specific pressure level can be specified for the multi-pressure using e.g., subset=pressure(500), while a specific time can be requested using e.g., datetime=2022-03-01 or subset=time("2022-03-01"). With Coverages and Maps, a spatial area of interest can be specified using either e.g., bbox=10,20,30,40 or subset=Lat(20:40),Lon(10:30).

At the moment, the Coverages API is limited to 2D output formats (spatial trim, slicing by time and pressure): GeoTIFF and PNG (16-bit output, currently fixed scale: 2.98 and offset: 16384). There is a plan to add support for n-dimensional output formats, including netCDF, CIS JSON and eventually CoverageJSON as well. Currently, separate API requests with the above parameters are needed for different times/pressure levels.

For coverage output, the fields can be selected using properties= (a single field for PNG, and one or more fields for GeoTIFF) e.g., properties=tasmin,tasmax The fields can also be derived using CQL2 expressions that can perform arithmetic e.g., properties=pr*1000.

With all these APIs, it is also possible to filter fields with filter= also specified as a CQL2 expression e.g., filter=tasmax>300 (unmatched cells will be replaced by NODATA values). The domains of the collections are described in the collection description (inside the extent property) as well as in the Coverages CIS DomainSet resource e.g., https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:singlePressure?f=json , https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:singlePressure/coverage/domainset?f=json

The ranges of the collections are described in the Coverages CIS RangeType resource as per the example below, and we are also planning to implement describing in a /schema resource that will be harmonized with the OGC API - Features schema. https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:cmip5:singlePressure/coverage/rangetype?f=json

(GeoTIFF output)
(using the default compact-zones=true where children zones are replaced by parent zone if all children zones are included)

By creating a kind of mask at a specifically requested resolution level, DGGS Zones Query can potentially greatly help parallelization and orchestration of spatial queries combining multiple datasets across multiple services, allowing to perform early optimizations with lazy evaluation.

As a test of higher resolution data, we also loaded an hourly dataset for the ERA5 relative humidity for the April 1-6, 2023 period at: https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/climate:era5:relativeHumidity

The spatial resolution for this one is also higher at 0.25 degrees longitude x 0.25 degrees latitude, and the data is for 37 different pressure levels.

We hope that our API and these climate datasets proves useful to other participants and can be part of Technology Integration Experiments for the pilots and/or Testbed 19 GeoDataCube. 

We have also been working on our client to visualize these data sources from local netCDF files, our native GNOSIS data store, or remotely through OGC APIs, and we are working on support for EDR in order to perform integration experiments with the NOAA EDR API.

We are also planning work on demonstrating the integration of these datasets as cross-collection queries and with our OGC API - Processes implementation including support for Part 3 - Workflows and Chaining.

One process we are putting together is a machine learning prediction process for classifying fuel vegetation types, based on sentinel-2 Level 2A accessed through our API at:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/sentinel2-l2a
 
The initial training data will be using this Fuel vegetation Type coverage for the whole continental US from landfire.gov available from our API at:

https://maps.gnosis.earth/ogcapi/collections/wildfire:USFuelVegetationTypes
 
More work is being done on loading additional fire danger indices from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.
