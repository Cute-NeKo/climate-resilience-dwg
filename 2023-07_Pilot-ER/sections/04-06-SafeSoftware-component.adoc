=== Safe Software

- Component:
 * Climate ARD component - Data Cube to ARD.
 * Impact Components general I/O (Heat, Drought, Flood).

- Inputs: 
 * Climate ARD component - Data Cube to ARD: Climate scenario data from climate services (NetCDF), for historic and future time periods
 * Impact Components general I/O (Heat, Drought, Flood): Climate impact ARD from Safes ARD component, including EO data (MODIS, LANDSAT, SENTINEL products), Population/Infrastructure information (OSM), Basemaps, as well as specific requirements per impact:
  * Drought: vegetation, soils, hydrology, basins
  * Flood: DEM, hydrology, basins.

- Outputs:
 * Climate ARD component - Data Cube to ARD: Gridded data, including temperature, soil moisture and  precipitation - aggregate grids (GeoTIFF/COG), as well as Vector data, including temperature, soil moisture and  precipitation contours (Geopackage, GeoJSON, OGC API Features).
 * Impact Components general I/O (Heat, Drought, Flood): Risk Contours (Geopackage, GeoJSON, OGC API Features).

- What other component(s) can interact with the component: Pixalytics Component: consume variables for Drought Indicator produced by Safeâ€™s ARD component. Any other component that requires climate scenario summary ARD to drive DRI.

- What OGC standards or formats does the component use and produce: 
 * OGC API Features
 * Geopackage
 * NetCDF
 * GeoJSON
 * GeoTIFF/COG
 * As needed: GML, KML, PostGIS, geodatabase and about 400 other geospatial formats.
