=== About Laubwerk

Laubwerk is a software development company whose mission is to combine accurate, broadly applicable visualizations of vegetation with deeper information and utility that goes far beyond their visual appearance. We achieve this through building a database that combines ultra-realisting 3D representation of plants with extensive metadata that represents plant properties. This unique combination makes Laubwerk a prime partner to bridge the gap from data-driven simulation to eye-catching visualizations.

=== About Pixalytics Ltd

Pixalytics Ltd is an independent consultancy company specializing in Earth Observation (EO). We combine cutting-edge scientific knowledge with satellite and airborne data to provide answers to questions about our planet's resources and behavior. The underlying work includes developing algorithms and software, with activities including a focus on EO quality control and end-user focused applications.

=== About Safe Software

Safe Software is a leader in supporting geospatial interoperability and automation for more than 25 years as creators of the FME platform. FME was created to promote FAIR principles, including data sharing across barriers and silos, with unparalleled support for a wide array of both vendor specific formats and open standards. Within this platform, Safe Software provides a range of tools to support interoperability workflows. FME Form is a graphical authoring environment that allows users to rapidly prototype transformation workflows in a no-code environment. FME Flow then allows users to publish data transforms to enterprise oriented service architectures. FME Hosted offers a low cost, easy to deploy and scalable environment for deploying transformation and integration services to the cloud.

Open standards have always been a core strategy for Safe to better support data sharing. The FME platform can be seen as a bridge between the many supported vendor protocols and open standards such as XML, JSON and OGC standards such as GML, KML, WMS, WFS and OGC APIs.  Safe has collaborated extensively over the years with the open standards community. Safe actively participates in the CityGML and INSPIRE communities in Europe. We are also active within the OGC community and participated in many initiatives including test beds, pilots such as Maritime Limits and Boundaries and IndoorGML, and most recently the 2021 Disaster Pilot and 2023 Climate Resilience Pilot. Safe also actively participates in a number of Domain and Standards working groups.
