==== About Laubwerk

Laubwerk is a software development company whose mission is to combine accurate, broadly applicable visualizations of vegetation with deeper information and utility that goes far beyond their visual appearance. We achieve this through building a database that combines ultra-realisting 3D representation of plants with extensive metadata that represents plant properties. This unique combination makes Laubwerk a prime partner to bridge the gap from data-driven simulation to eye-catching visualizations.

==== About Pixalytics Ltd

Pixalytics Ltd is an independent consultancy company specializing in Earth Observation (EO). We combine cutting-edge scientific knowledge with satellite and airborne data to provide answers to questions about our planet's resources and behavior. The underlying work includes developing algorithms and software, with activities including a focus on EO quality control and end-user focused applications.

==== About Safe Software

Safe Software is a leader in supporting geospatial interoperability and automation for more than 25 years as creators of the FME platform. FME was created to promote FAIR principles, including data sharing across barriers and silos, with unparalleled support for a wide array of both vendor specific formats and open standards. Within this platform, Safe Software provides a range of tools to support interoperability workflows. FME Form is a graphical authoring environment that allows users to rapidly prototype transformation workflows in a no-code environment. FME Flow then allows users to publish data transforms to enterprise oriented service architectures. FME Hosted offers a low cost, easy to deploy and scalable environment for deploying transformation and integration services to the cloud.

Open standards have always been a core strategy for Safe to better support data sharing. The FME platform can be seen as a bridge between the many supported vendor protocols and open standards such as XML, JSON and OGC standards such as GML, KML, WMS, WFS and OGC APIs.  Safe has collaborated extensively over the years with the open standards community. Safe actively participates in the CityGML and INSPIRE communities in Europe. We are also active within the OGC community and participated in many initiatives including test beds, pilots such as Maritime Limits and Boundaries and IndoorGML, and most recently the 2021 Disaster Pilot and 2023 Climate Resilience Pilot. Safe also actively participates in a number of Domain and Standards working groups.

==== About Intact

Intact Financial Corporation (IFC) is the largest provider of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance in Canada. Its purpose is to help people, businesses and society prosper in good times and be resilient in bad times [1]. The company has been on the front lines of climate change with our customers for more than a decade – getting them back on track and helping them adapt. As extreme weather is going to get worse over the next decade, Intact intends to double down on adapting to this changing environment and be better prepared for floods, wildfire and extreme heat [2].

With close to 500 experts in data, artificial intelligence, machine learning and pricing, the Intact Data Lab has deployed almost 300 AI models in production to-date. It is focused on improving risk selection and making operations as efficient as possible while creating outstanding interactions with customers. Within Intact’s Data Lab, the Centre for Climate and Geospatial Analytics (CCGA) uses weather, climate, and geospatial data along with machine learning models and claims data to develop risk maps and other specialized products to the business.

==== About Pelagis

Pelagis is an OceanTech venture located in Nova Scotia, Canada. Our foundation focuses on the application of open geospatial technology and standards designed to promote the sustainable use of our ocean resources. As a member of the Open Geospatial Consortium, we co-chair the Marine Domain Working Group responsible for developing a spatially-aware federated service model of marine and coastal ecosystems.

==== About alpS

The alpS GmbH is an international engineering and consulting firm that supports companies, municipalities, and governments in their sustainable development and in dealing with the consequences, opportunities, and risks of climate change. Over the last 20 years alpS has worked with more than 250 municipalities and industrial partners. alpS accompanied a large number of adaptation cycles from vulnerability assessments to the implementation of adaptation measures and their evaluation.

=== Component workflow

Interoperability plays a vital role in facilitating climate resilience by enabling seamless integration and exchange of information between data, models, and various components. During this pilot, participanta have worked on a number of workflows and architectures focusing on several use cases of droughts, heatwaves, and fires. Generally speaking, such a workflow or process takes the following form and tasks: 

- Data Identification and Acquisition: Relevant geospatial data sources related to droughts, heatwaves, and fires, such as satellite imagery, climate datasets, weather station records, and historical fire data, are identified. Data providers are contacted to acquire the necessary data, ensuring permissions and licenses are obtained.

- Data Harmonization and Integration: The acquired data, often in diverse formats and resolutions, undergoes harmonization to standardize formats, units, and coordinate systems. Data integration techniques are applied to combine different datasets into a coherent dataset, such as integrating meteorological data with vegetation indices to assess drought conditions.

- Data Storage and Management: The harmonized and integrated dataset is stored in a centralized data repository or distributed systems, facilitating efficient storage, retrieval, and management. Metadata, including data descriptions and spatial-temporal information, are cataloged for improved data discovery and accessibility.

- Model Selection or Development: Appropriate models, such as hydrological models for drought assessment, heat stress models for heatwave evaluation, and fire spread models for predicting fire behavior, are selected or developed. The models must be compatible with the data and interoperable with other components.

- Model Configuration and Calibration: Selected or developed models are configured to suit the study area and calibrated using historical data. Calibration ensures accurate simulation of drought severity, heat stress levels, and fire behavior based on the input data.

- Model Execution and Simulation: The configured and calibrated models are executed using the preprocessed dataset. They simulate droughts, heatwaves, and fires, generating outputs like drought severity indices, heat stress metrics, and fire spread patterns, aiding impact assessment and vulnerability identification.

- Model Integration and Ensemble Approaches: Ensemble approaches enhance predictions by integrating multiple models with different algorithms or parameterizations. This ensemble integration provides a comprehensive understanding of uncertainties associated with modeled outcomes, supporting decision-making.

- Visualization and Analysis: Simulation outputs, along with the original data, are visualized and analyzed. Geospatial visualization techniques represent spatiotemporal patterns of droughts, heatwaves, and fires. Analytical tools and statistical methods identify trends, anomalies, and potential correlations between variables.

- Decision Support and Communication: Analyzed results are communicated to stakeholders, policymakers, and communities. Decision support systems translate insights into actionable information for climate resilience strategies. Visualizations, reports, and interactive platforms effectively communicate findings.

- Iterative Refinement: The workflow is iterative, allowing for refinement and improvements based on feedback, additional data, or advancements in models and technologies. Continuous evaluation and refinement ensure the workflow remains effective and up-to-date for climate resilience efforts.

By following such a process or workflow, the interoperability of data, models, and components is maximized, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of droughts, heatwaves, and fires and supporting informed decision-making for climate resilience strategies.
