=== About Laubwerk

Laubwerk is a software development company whose mission is to combine accurate, broadly applicable visualizations of vegetation with deeper information and utility that goes far beyond their visual appearance. We achieve this through building a database that combines ultra-realisting 3D representation of plants with extensive metadata that represents plant properties. This unique combination makes Laubwerk a prime partner to bridge the gap from data-driven simulation to eye-catching visualizations.
