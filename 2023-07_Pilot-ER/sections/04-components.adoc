=== ECMWF - Cppernicus

- Component: Copernicus services.

- Outputs: Copernicus Services, including Climate Data Store (CDS) https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/ and Atmosphere Data Store (ADS) https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/. 

- What other component(s) can interact with the component: CDS and ADS provide access to data via different interfaces: UI and API. It also offers a toolbox with a set of expert libraries to perform advanced operations on the available data. CDS and ADS catalogue metadata is also accessible via standard CSW. https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/geonetwork/srv/eng/csw?SERVICE=CSW&VERSION=2.0.2&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

- What OGC standards or formats does the component use and produce: 
  * CDS and ADS catalogues exposed via CSW. 
  * Access to ESGF datasets via WPS. 
  * WMS is offered in some published applications. 
  * CADS 2.0 (under construction) will implement OGC APIs.

=== Pixalytics

Pixalytics are developing an OGC-compliant API service, see <<Pixalytics_architecture>>, which will provide global information on droughts. The approach is to take global open data/datasets from organizations such as ESA/Copernicus, NASA/NOAA and the WMO and combine meteorology, hydrology, and remote sensing data to produce ARD data based on a composite of different indicators. Where globally calculated drought indicators already exist, these are being used in preference to their re-calculation, although consistency and the presence of uncertainties are also being considered.

[[Pixalytics_architecture]]

Currently, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is being calculated using ERA5 reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The API access is being set up following the Building Blocks for Climate Services (https://climateintelligence.github.io/smartduck-docs/) approach. Once all steps are working for SPI, the next step is adding soil moisture and vegetation drought indices. Also, work on how to combine indices into a single view/indicator is being considered.

- Component: Drought indicator.

- What other component(s) can interact with the component: a desire to link to visualization/DRI analysis components. A QGIS plugin has been updated to be able to perform a request and view the outputted JSON file (https://github.com/pixalytics-ltd/qgis-wps-plugin) and the WPS link is https://api.pixalytics.com/climate/wps?request=GetCapabilities&service=wps (under testing/improvement for robustness).

- What OGC standards or formats does the component use and produce: Producing data on-the-fly using the Web Processing Service (WPS), so need to pull data through preferably an API route.
