=== Wuhan University (WHU)
Wuhan University (WHU) is a university that plays a significant role in researching and teaching all aspects of surveying and mapping, remote sensing, photogrammetry, and geospatial information sciences in China. In this Climate Resilience Pilot, we will contribute two use-cases: a use-case for drought and wildfire impact, and a use-case for analysis ready data.

- Component:  Data Cube and Drought Indicator.

- Inputs: Climate data, including precipitation and temperature. Optical data, such as Landsat-8 and sentinel-2.

- Outputs: Drought risk map and other results in the form of GeoTIFF after processing in a Data Cube.

- What other component(s) can interact with the component: .

- What OGC standards or formats does the component use and produce: 
  * OGC API - Coverages to provide the data in Cube
  * OGC API - Processes to provide the calculation of drought indices
