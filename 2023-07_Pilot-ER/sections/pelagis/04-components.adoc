With a global population adding over 80 million people every year, annual production yields from aquaculture must increase by an estimated 40% by the year 2030.  As the carrying capacity of our oceans is reaching its limits, research suggests that by focusing on sustainable best practices for food production from the ocean, not only can we meet the needs of global food supplies but we can also look to reduce the rate of ocean acidification and permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

Pelagis is an ocean-tech company founded in Nova Scotia, Canada supporting initiatives related to the sustainable use of our ocean resources. Our participation in the Climate Resilience pilot focuses on enhancing our view of a global oceans observation system by combining real-world ground observations with analysis ready datasets. Monitoring aspects of our oceans through both a temporal and spatial continuum while providing traceability through the observations process allows stakeholders to better understand the stressors affecting the health of our oceans and investigate opportunities to mitigate the longer term implications related to climate change.

Technically, the focus of our research is on federated systems ...
