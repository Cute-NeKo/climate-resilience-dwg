== Lessons Learned

The various organizations and institutes that contribute to the Climate Resilience Pilot noted the following gaps or challenges that still require some work (in future):

- At present participants have only implemented the first Drought Index (SPI) using precipitation data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), but are open to / need other data sources.

- One of the objectives of the pilot is also to lower the barriers for users accessing CDS/ADS (Atmosperic Data Store) data and services and engage with a broader user community. Knowing from users which are these barriers (gaps) will allow this pilot to evolve as well.

- A universal, well-defined, climate service workflow (from raw data to information) as a roadmap to guide developers/users through the process.

- Improve Sentinel-2 data cube performance, add Climate data, add vegetation fuel type classification, add a wildfire risk assessment workflow.
