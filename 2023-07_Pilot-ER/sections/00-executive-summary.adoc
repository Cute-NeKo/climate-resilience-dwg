== Excecutive Summary

This OGC Climate Resilience Pilot represents the first phase of multiple long term climate activities aiming to evolve geospatial data, technologies, and other capabilities into valuable information for decision makers, scientists, policy makers, data providers, software developers, and service providers. The ultimate goal is to make valuable, informed decisions to improve climate action, especially by helping the location community develop more powerful visualization and communication tools to accurately address ongoing climate threats such as heat, drought, floods, fires as well as supporting the national and international commitments for greenhouse gas emission reduction. 

One of the biggest challenges to achieve this, is to move big, raw data from multiple sources into data processing pipelines to make data ready for analysis and climate change impact assessments. As a first important step in this direction, participants in this pilot applied data enhancement steps, such as bias adjustments, re-gridding, and calculation of climate indicators and essential variables, which led to “Decision Ready Indicators.” The spatial data infrastructures required for this integration has been designed with interoperable building blocks following FAIR data principles. Using different climate riak and impact use cases, heterogeneous data from multiple sources has been enhanced, adjusted, refined, and quality controlled to provide Science Services data products for Climate Resilience. The OGC Climate Change Services Pilots has also illustrated the graphical exploration of the Decision Ready Climate Data. It has demonstrated a framework for the design of FAIR climate services information systems. In a nutshell, the first OGC Pilot demonstrators have illustrated the necessary tools and the visualisations to address climate actions moving towards climate resilience.

Based on the generated data information, there are several areas of focus and further exploration for the scenario tests and analysis in the context of climate data processing. Here is a breakdown of the key points that should be addressed in follow-on activities:

- Comparison with historical norms: calculate the difference between historical maximum temperatures and projected maximum temperatures. This analysis can provide insights into the changes in temperature patterns over time.

- Higher resolution time steps: conduct analysis using weekly and daily time steps instead of monthly time steps. While monthly time steps were initially used for prototyping workflows, analyzing data at finer resolutions can provide more detailed and accurate information. However, it should be noted that processing daily time steps will require significantly more computational resources and time.

- Regarding drought indicator: currently implemented using data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), but need to explore other sources/datasets to understand speed, reliability, and cost of accessing input data from different sources. Testing different data sources will help determine the most efficient and cost-effective approach for accessing necessary data.

- Lowering barriers for user access: One of the objectives is to reduce barriers for users accessing CDS/ADS data and services. Gathering feedback from users about existing gaps and challenges will help improve the pilot project and engage a broader user community.

And finally,

- Develop a well-defined universal climate service workflow.
