In recognizing the impacts of climate change and monitoring the environment to achieve Sustainable Development Goals collaborative solutions  are required. This calls for standardized data and tools. But how can we ensure an effective exchange of reliable information across disciplines without sacrificing individual users' needs? Climate services require vast volumes of data from different providers to be processed by various scientific ecosystems: Raw data needs to be transformed into analysis ready data and from there into indicators that is ready for supporting decisions'. To provide a processing infrastructure that supports collaboration, we need standards based on the principles of being findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. OGC standards are aligned with these principles allowing for the reuse of data refinement features across countries, organizations, and administrative levels. 

In this OGC Climate Resilience Pilot, which had been the first phase of multiple long term climate activities the work was aiming to evolve geospatial data, technologies, and other capabilities into valuable information for decision makers, scientists, policy makers, data providers, software developers, and service providers. It had been shown how data piplines could be established to produce dedicated information out of the massive amount of availabel raw data. It has been shown how raw data from multiple sources can be organised into data processing pipelines to bring them in formats ready for analysis. different aspects of GEODataCubes are discussed to emphseise the necessesity of analysis ready data and decission ready indicators. 
Scicetific related aspects of climate impact are beeing discussed with the use cases of droughts, floods and wildfires, where assessment tools and the complexity of climate indices are layed out.

With the target user group of non technical decission makers, the workflow from data to visulisation is beeing shown at several chapters of this report. A dadicated chaper is pointing out the options and challenges of usage on artifical intelligence to establsh a 5D meta world where the efficiency of climate action can be simulated. Reduction of disaster risks du to technical engineering constructions like dams are able to be simulated. Climate resilience is not only an aspect of shift of meteorological phenomena but also related to land degradation and loss of biodiversity. Therefor the vegetation is been pointed out and options of 3D vegetation simulation is shown and how different species are surviving under changing cliamte condictions. It could be shwon that smale scale urban planning is beeing supported by the data to visualisation application where single tree species are representing the real or simulated situation of a small scale area. The pilot is showing studies of Los Angeles. 

The pilot points out the challenges on how to bring information to the decission makers. Even a dedicated chapter and focus  on comunication is included in the pilots work. Speceal approaches showing the comunication options to non technical people who are in charege of local climate ressilince action startegies. 

The cliamte resilince pilot could show how to make valuable, informed decisions to improve climate action, especially by helping the location community develop more powerful visualization and communication tools to accurately address ongoing climate threats such as heat, drought, floods, fires.
