=== ECMWF - Copernicus

- Component: Copernicus services.

- Outputs: Copernicus Services, including Climate Data Store (CDS) https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/ and Atmosphere Data Store (ADS) https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/. 

- What other component(s) can interact with the component: CDS and ADS provide access to data via different interfaces: UI and API. It also offers a toolbox with a set of expert libraries to perform advanced operations on the available data. CDS and ADS catalogue metadata is also accessible via standard CSW. https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/geonetwork/srv/eng/csw?SERVICE=CSW&VERSION=2.0.2&REQUEST=GetCapabilities

- What OGC standards or formats does the component use and produce: 
  * CDS and ADS catalogues exposed via CSW. 
  * Access to ESGF datasets via WPS. 
  * WMS is offered in some published applications. 
  * CADS 2.0 (under construction) will implement OGC APIs.


=== AlpS

- Component: climate Communication and support for adaptation.

- Inputs: Selected climate indicators (past and future, different scenarios), cartographic data (hazard zones, HQ areas, etc.), existing plans, strategies and concepts (regional development plans, climate protection strategies, previous analyses).

- Outputs: Target group-specific communication material (factsheets, graphs), description of the vulnerability and visualization of risk maps, adaptation measures, strategies for adaptation to climate change. In the context of this pilot alpS will elaborate a guideline that helps to find a proper workshop-setup. alpS will illustrate the guideline with two to three best practice examples. As far as possible, alpS will test its findings in ongoing consultancies.
