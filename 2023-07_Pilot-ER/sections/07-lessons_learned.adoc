Participants of the various organizations and institutes that contribute to the Climate Resilience Pilot noted the following gaps or challenges do still exist and require additional work (in future) to overcome:

Currently, the Pixaltics Drought indicator utilizes data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). However, the project is in the process of testing various other sources and datasets to assess the speed, reliability, and cost of accessing input data from different providers. The goal is to enable on-demand data processing.

During the testing phase, we compared the input precipitation data obtained from the ERA5 dataset within the Registry of Open Data on AWS to the CDS API. It was found that accessing the data stored on Amazon Web Service (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) was faster once virtual Zarrs were set up. However, there are concerns regarding the data's provenance, as it was uploaded to AWS by an organization other than the original data provider. Additionally, the Zarr approach faced challenges when dealing with more recent years' data, as the NetCDFs stored on S3 had inconsistent chunking. To address this issue, a request has been submitted to enhance the Python kerchunk library's ability to handle variable chunking. We are pointing this out as it is not specific to this datasource; these challenges can happen to any large datasource that needs to transform into Zarrs to operate faster.

The pilot project aims to achieve multiple objectives, one of which is to reduce the obstacles that users face when accessing CDS/ADS (Atmospheric Data Store) data and services. By identifying these barriers or gaps from the users' perspective, the pilot can adapt and evolve accordingly. This approach ensures that the project engages a broader user community and facilitates their interaction with CDS/ADS.

To provide a clear direction for developers and users, the pilot intends to establish a universal and well-defined climate service workflow. This workflow will serve as a roadmap, guiding individuals through the entire process from raw data to actionable information. By offering a structured framework, the project aims to enhance efficiency and streamline the utilization of climate services.

Several enhancements were planned for the project, including improvements to the performance of the Sentinel-2 data cube. Climate data can be incorporated in this, and vegetation fuel type classification as well. This to support a wildfire risk assessment workflow. These enhancements contribute to expanding the capabilities and functionalities of the pilot project.

The principles of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) are not limited to Earth Observation (EO) data alone. They can also be applied to climate time series data. An effective ARD should be adaptable to various scenarios and capable of addressing a wide range of analytic inquiries. By adopting ARD principles, the pilot aims to generate data that can be readily queried to extract valuable insights regarding climate trends.

During the DP21 phase, a solid foundation was established for exploring data cube extraction and conversion to ARD. The FME data integration platform played a crucial role in facilitating these processes. Furthermore, numerous approaches were explored for tasks such as data extraction, simplification, and transformation. Additionally, different methods were investigated for selecting, splitting, aggregating, and summarizing time series. The evaluation involved assessing both band and cell statistics to determine their effectiveness. The primary objective was to generate ARD capable of answering questions related to climate trends.

Further experimentation is required to enhance the project's capabilities. This experimentation encompasses various aspects, including analytic techniques, statistical methods, simplification processes, and publication methodologies. Additionally, the project aims to explore cloud-native approaches such as NetCDF to COG conversion and the utilization of APIs. These ongoing experiments contribute to refining the project's methodologies and expanding its range of applications.

The classification rules employed by the project need to more accurately model the impacts of interest. For instance, incorporating business rules related to temperature range and statistical types should form an integral part of the classification process before converting the data into vectors. By refining the classification rules, the project aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated results.

Currently, the participants have implemented the first Drought Index (SPI) using precipitation data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). However, they are open to incorporating additional data sources as per the project's requirements. This flexibility ensures that the pilot project remains adaptable to evolving needs and can utilize diverse datasets to enhance its outputs.

In summary, the pilot project seeks to overcome barriers and engage a wider user community by facilitating access to CDS/ADS data and services. A well-defined climate service workflow will guide developers and users through the entire process, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness. Enhancements to the Sentinel-2 data cube, the inclusion of climate data and vegetation fuel type classification, and the development of a wildfire risk assessment workflow will expand the project's capabilities. By applying ARD principles and refining classification rules, the project aims to generate valuable insights into climate trends. Ongoing experimentation and the exploration of different methods contribute to the project's continuous improvement.
